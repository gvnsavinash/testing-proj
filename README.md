### How to run

Run the project with customizable redaction settings using command-line flags:

bash :
pipenv run python redactor.py --input '*.txt' --names --dates --phones --address --concept '<topic>' --output '<file_path>/' --stats stderr


**Example**:
bash :
pipenv run python redactor.py --input '*.txt' --names --dates --phones --address --concept 'call' --output 'files/' --stats stdout

   - This will redact names, dates, phones , address and concept for the given text and save into files directory with a name of sample.censored and sample_stats1.txt 


**Command-line Flags**:
- `--names`, `--dates`, `--phones`, `--address`: Enable redaction for specified entity types.
- `--concept`: Custom term for censoring related sentences.
- `--output`: Directory for saving censored files.
- `--stats`: Specifies where to output redaction statistics (`stderr`, `stdout`, or a file path).

---

**Internal Python Package**
In this project utilizes the us package to directly access U.S. state abbreviations, aiding in the redaction of address information by identifying and redacting state names effectively.

Overview
The us package provides a complete list of U.S. states with their standard abbreviations, such as:

1. "Florida" as "FL"
2. "California" as "CA"
This ensures that state names, when encountered in addresses, are easily identified and redacted without needing additional processing for redacting the address.

### Modules and Function Descriptions

#### 1. **Pattern Matching and Entity Extraction (`pattern_matcher.py`)**

This module defines `extract_using_regex` to perform regex-based entity extraction from text, identifying several predefined entity types.

**`extract_using_regex(text)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   The `extract_using_regex` function extracts specified types of entities from text using regex patterns. The purpose is to identify data points such as names, dates, emails, phone numbers, and addresses, which are commonly sensitive information. This function is essential because it allows customizable and precise identification of sensitive information without requiring machine learning or NLP models. It works by defining a dictionary of patterns for each entity type, then iterating over these patterns and applying `re.findall` to extract matches from the text.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text` (str): The input text from which entities are to be extracted.

- **Returns**:
  - `dict`: Dictionary with entity types (e.g., "PERSON", "EMAIL") as keys and lists of extracted entities as values.

- **Details**:
**Regex Patterns**
1. PERSON
      Identify Names 
      Examples:
      "Emily"
      "Smith"
      "David Johnson"
2. EMAIL
    Matches standard email formats, allowing for the extraction of names. For instance, in Emily@gmail.com, "Emily" is recognized as the name.

    Examples:
    "mary_smith@yahoo.com"
    "alice.jones@company.co.uk"
    "user123@domain.org"
    "contact.me@service.com"
    "info@business.site"
    "test.email+filter@gmail.com"
    "firstname.lastname@company.com"
    "my.email@subdomain.domain.com"
    "customer.service@helpdesk.net"
3. PHONE
Matches phone numbers in both common and international formats, accounting for country codes, separators, and area codes.

    Examples:
    "(555) 123-4567"
    "555-987-6543"
    "+1 800 555 0199"
    "1-800-555-0199"
    "555.555.1212"

4. ADDRESS
Recognizes Address in various Format 

Examples:
" New York "
"789 Park Blvd, Room 101, Houston"

5. DATE

    "2022/03/25"
    "25.03.22"
    "March 2022"
    "03-25-22"


Functionality
This system relies on predefined regex patterns to accurately identify each entity type, ensuring that only explicitly defined patterns are matched. This approach minimizes false positives and guarantees precise data extraction, facilitating secure processing of sensitive information.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  text = "Emily was born on October 31, 2024. His email is Emily@example.com."
  extract_using_regex(text)
  ```
- **Logging**: The function logs extraction results for each entity type at the debug level, helping trace its performance during execution.

  This log file records debugging information throughout the redaction process. Key details include (This will saved on docs/codelogger.log):

    1. File Listing: Logs the files retrieved based on specified patterns (e.g., text_files/*.txt).
    2. Entity Extraction: Captures the results of regex-based entity extraction, showing entities identified as PERSON, EMAIL, PHONE, ADDRESS, and DATE. The log notes each type, along with any matched patterns (e.g., phone numbers, addresses).
    3. Extraction Stages: The file logs various processing stages, such as "Regex Extraction" and "SpaCy NER Extraction," including the lists of entities identified at each stage.
    4. Output Results: Provides statistics on the redacted information, summarizing counts of names, dates, phone numbers, and addresses identified.
    5. This log helps trace each step of the tool’s execution, providing insights into the regex matches, entity extraction outcomes, and overall redaction statistics, making it valuable for debugging and verifying the redaction process

#### 2. **Helper Functions for Redaction (`helper.py`)**

This module includes several helper functions to perform redaction and manage file operations. It also includes internal functions for retrieving related terms and censoring sentences based on a list of keywords.

**`apply_redaction(text, entities, redact_names=False, redact_dates=False, redact_phones=False, redact_address=False, redact_topics=[])`**
- **Purpose**:  
   `apply_redaction` censors sensitive entities in the input text by replacing them with block characters (`█`). It uses the provided flags to determine which entities to redact, then iterates over the entities in the text, matching and replacing occurrences. This function provides flexibility in what to redact based on command-line arguments. After entity redaction, if any additional topics are specified in `redact_topics`, the function calls `hide_terms_in_sentences` to censor entire sentences containing these terms.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text` (str): Input text to be redacted.
  - `entities` (dict): Dictionary where each key is an entity type (e.g., "PERSON") and each value is a list of entities.
  - `redact_names`, `redact_dates`, `redact_phones`, `redact_address` (bool): Flags to indicate which entity types to redact.
  - `redact_topics` (list): List of additional terms or topics to redact in full sentences.

- **Returns**:
  - `str`: Text with redacted entities and topics replaced by `█` characters.

- **Internal Mechanics**:
   - `apply_redaction` begins by setting up a dictionary that maps each entity type to its redaction flag (e.g., `redact_names` for `PERSON`).
   - For each entity type that has a corresponding flag enabled, it replaces each occurrence with a redacted version.
   - After entity-level redaction, if `redact_topics` is specified, it calls `hide_terms_in_sentences` to handle sentence-level redaction based on the specified topics.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  apply_redaction("Contact Emily at 555-456-7890.", {"PERSON": ["Emily"], "PHONE": ["555-456-7890"]}, redact_names=True, redact_phones=True)
  ```

**`list_files(folder_pattern)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   Lists files in the directory that match a specified pattern (e.g., “*.txt”). This is useful for batch processing of files, allowing the tool to process single/multiple files in one run. The function uses the glob module, making it compatible with Unix-style wildcards for flexible file selection.

- **Arguments**:
  - `folder_pattern` (str): Pattern for matching files, such as “*.txt” to match all text files.

- **Returns**:
  - `list`: List of file paths that match the specified pattern.

**`get_related_words(concept)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   Retrieves a list of related terms for a specified concept using WordNet. This function expands redaction coverage by including synonyms, hypernyms (broader terms), and hyponyms (more specific terms) for the provided concept. This additional coverage ensures that the redaction process accounts for a broader scope of related words, enhancing data security.

- **Arguments**:
  - `concept` (str): Concept or term for which related terms should be identified.

- **Returns**:
  - `list`: List of related terms for redaction.

- **Internal Mechanics**:
  - `get_related_words` uses the `wordnet` module to find synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. Each term is processed to remove WordNet suffixes (e.g., “.n.01”), ensuring the terms appear in a natural language format.

**`hide_terms_in_sentences(text, related_words)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   This function redacts entire sentences containing any word in the `related_words` list. It first splits the text into sentences, then checks each sentence for matches. If a match is found, the sentence is replaced with a redacted block. This function is particularly useful for concept-based redaction, where specific words in a sentence warrant full censorship.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text` (str): Input text.
  - `related_words` (list): List of words to search for within sentences.

- **Returns**:
  - `str`: Text with redacted sentences.

#### 3. **Main Redaction Functionality (`redactor.py`)**

The main script combines all helper functions, regex, and NLP

 processing into a comprehensive redaction workflow.

**`find_addresses_with_pyap(text)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   Finds U.S. addresses within the input text using the Pyap library. This function supplements the regex-based address extraction by leveraging Pyap’s built-in patterns for U.S. address formats, enhancing accuracy in redacting geographic data.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text` (str): Input text to search for addresses.

- **Returns**:
  - `list`: List of addresses found in the text.

**`print_debug_info(stage, names=None, dates=None, phones=None, addresses=None)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   Logs detailed debug information at various stages of processing. This function helps trace each extraction and redaction phase, outputting entities identified at each stage (e.g., after regex extraction or SpaCy processing). The purpose is to aid debugging and verification during development.

- **Arguments**:
  - `stage` (str): Current stage of processing.
  - `names`, `dates`, `phones`, `addresses` (list, optional): Lists of extracted entities for logging.

**`format_entity_stats(file, args, names, dates, phones, addresses)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   Formats statistics on redacted entities for output. The function constructs a summary of all redacted entities (e.g., names, dates, phones) for each processed file. The purpose is to provide a concise report of what was redacted in each file, supporting data governance and tracking.

- **Arguments**:
  - `file` (str): The name of the processed file.
  - `args` (Namespace): Command-line arguments controlling which entities to include.
  - `names`, `dates`, `phones`, `addresses` (list): Lists of entities found.

- **Returns**:
  - `str`: Formatted string with redaction statistics.

## The stdout/stderr/file format
The stats structure will be outputted in the following format after running the file using the above command.

*Format:*

                File: <file.txt>, 
                Names: 0, 
                Dates: 0, 
                Phones: 0, 
                Addresses: 0, 

*Sample Output:*

                File: sample.txt, 
                Names: 2, 
                Dates: 1, 
                Phones: 1, 
                Addresses: 2, 

**`redact_sensitive_info(text_input, args, topics=None)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   The primary redaction function, `redact_sensitive_info`, manages the entire process. It reads the input text, extracts entities using regex and SpaCy, combines results, and then applies redactions based on the flags specified in `args`. This function serves as the backbone of the redaction system, orchestrating regex and NLP-based extraction and coordinating calls to other functions (like `apply_redaction` and `find_addresses_with_pyap` (which i already explaned above) ) for comprehensive redaction.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text_input` (str): Path to the file or the text content itself.
  - `args` (Namespace): Flags for different redaction types.
  - `topics` (list, optional): Custom topics for concept-based redaction.

- **Returns**:
  - `tuple`: Contains redacted text, and lists of identified names, dates, phones, and addresses.

**`main(args)`**
- **Purpose**:  
   The main function orchestrates the entire redaction workflow. It parses command-line arguments, processes files, applies redactions, and saves outputs. Additionally, it generates redaction statistics, saving them in the output directory. This function is the entry point when running `redactor.py` as a standalone script.

- **Arguments**:
  - `args` (Namespace): Command-line arguments controlling input, output, and redaction options.

## Bugs and Assumptions

1. Regex and NLP Limitations
  1. Based on the project’s design, the entity extraction depends heavily on regex patterns and SpaCy’s NLP model. While these methods are effective for common formats, they might miss entities that don’t follow standard structures, particularly with names, addresses, and phone numbers.
  2. The address regex pattern is built around specific assumptions like full street names and postal codes, so addresses missing these elements or with abbreviations may not be properly redacted.
  3. The SpaCy model is optimized for English, so redaction may be less accurate for non-English texts.

2. File Format and Input Assumptions
  1. This tool is most effective with well-structured text that adheres to standard rules for punctuation, spacing, and capitalization. If the input text has inconsistent or non-standard formatting, the redaction results might not be as accurate.
  2. It’s designed to handle plain text files and doesn’t account for complex document formats like PDFs with embedded images or structured formats like HTML or JSON. This limits its effectiveness when handling highly formatted or data-rich text structures.

3. Dependency and Encoding Constraints
  1. The project uses several external libraries (SpaCy, Pyap, NLTK), each with unique installation requirements. An initial internet connection is needed to download WordNet data for NLTK, which may affect usage in offline environments.
  2. TF-8 encoding is assumed for all input files; files with different encodings, particularly those containing special characters, might not process correctly. Also, the use of Unix-style patterns for batch processing can create compatibility issues on some systems, particularly Windows.

4. I didn’t have the opportunity to use Snorkel’s LFApplier or LabelModel in this project. However, I utilized Snorkel’s labeling_function decorator to enhance my regex_match function. By applying this decorator, the function can now ABSTAIN when it doesn’t find relevant matches, instead of assigning a random label. This ensures higher accuracy by avoiding uncertain or arbitrary labels when the function lacks sufficient information.

5. Security and Privacy Considerations
  1. Since redacted files are stored in the output directory, any incomplete redaction could expose sensitive data. Therefore, it’s crucial to restrict access to this directory.
  2. The tool assumes a text-based input structure, which means it may struggle with heavily formatted or nested data types like JSON or XML. This assumption could limit its utility when working with more complex data formats.

6. I didn’t have the opportunity to use Snorkel’s LFApplier or LabelModel in this project. However, I utilized Snorkel’s labeling_function decorator to enhance my regex_match function. By applying this decorator, the function can now ABSTAIN when it doesn’t find relevant matches, instead of assigning a random label. This ensures higher accuracy by avoiding uncertain or arbitrary labels when the function lacks sufficient information.
